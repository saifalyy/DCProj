**IMPLEMENTATION OF LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY DECENTRALIZED TWITTER USING ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN.**

The demand for decentralization has surged exponentially in the recent past, with high chance of growing further in the coming future.
In this project we focus on implementing a decentralized version of Twitter with following functionalities. 
    1) Meta-mask based authentication.
    2) Functionality to add and manage Tweets.
    3) Minting your profile picture as an NFT
    
    
**To Run the Code locally:**
The code makes use of Javascript completely, and having NodeJS on your system is a necessery requirement.
Clone the repository, and run command "npx install" in each of the folder (tweeter, smart contract, studio)
To connect to Sanity, make sure you create a account on Sanity.io, and obtain your api keys.
Run script "npm run dev" in tweeter folder & "sanity start" to initialize sanity studio.
